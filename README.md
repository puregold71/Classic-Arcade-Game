# Classic Arcade Game
Game based on the classic arcade game, Frogger

## Object of Game
Little Pink Girl is looking for love! Collect all 5 hearts to win.
Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left or right, but be careful of the oncoming cockroaches. If you get hit, you will be sent back to the grass. Once you reach the top row, collect your heart by pushing the up arrow. While on the top row, player may not move left or right (that would be too easy!). You may enter through the top row whether or not a heart is there, however, you will not get any points for an empty space. Once all hearts are collected, player wins. There is a Play Again button should you wish to play again.
